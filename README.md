# Wi-Fi Security Scanner

A web application that scans nearby Wi-Fi networks, visualizes signal strength trends, and provides risk assessment, including detection of open or potentially unsafe networks.

---

## Features

- Scan all nearby Wi-Fi networks.
- Display SSID, BSSID, signal strength, security type, and risk level.
- Track signal strength trends (last 10 readings) with interactive graphs.
- Detect potentially unsafe networks (open/WEP) for quick risk visualization.
- Works as a single server serving both backend API and frontend.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, PyWiFi
- **Frontend:** React, Chart.js
- **Server:** Uvicorn

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will learn:

- How to interact with Wi-Fi hardware programmatically using Python (pywifi).
- Creating REST APIs with FastAPI and serving static frontend files.
- Integrating React with backend APIs for real-time data visualization.
- Using Chart.js to render dynamic and interactive signal graphs.
- Assessing Wi-Fi security and understanding risks of open/WEP networks.
- Combining frontend and backend into a single deployable server.
